# How-Neural-Networks-learn-from-both-Labeled-and-Unlabeled-data

## Overview
This project uses a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each image is 28x28 pixels. The goal is to train a neural network to classify these digits.

### What’s Included:
- **Code** to build and train a neural network model on the MNIST dataset.
- **Tutorial (PDF)** that explains how to create the neural network model and train it on the MNIST dataset.

## Prerequisites
To use the code, you’ll need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries like TensorFlow (or other similar libraries), NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Tutorial
There is a detailed step-by-step tutorial in PDF format to guide you through the process of building and training the neural network model. You can find it in the `tutorial/tutorial.pdf` file.

## License
- The code and tutorial in this project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.
